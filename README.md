# Affined
C# OBDII Reader

### What is Affined?
Affined is a C# Library, Simulator and Data Reader for a vehicles OBDII port under the dash. It will display information from your car and display it on any windows tablet or laptop or computer. You will also be able to see trouble codes and (if you are confident enough) clear them.

### Is this usable?
As of right now no. It is still being developed and tested. Some code is missing in which I have yet to upload the changes of them. When ever I have some spare time is when I work on this.

### Why C#?
Well as my current job is in .NET technology I figured I'd translate my current Python OBDII application to C# to help expand my C# portfolio.
